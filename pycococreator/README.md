### Creating COCO Dataset   

Detectron's input format supports the below builtin data format.   
-  COCO instance/keypoint detection   
- PanopticFPN   
- LVIS instance segmentation   
- cityscapes   
- Pascal VOC   


I implemented this project with COCO instance detection builtin dataset format.  
This directory contains scripts I used to turn files into COCO formats.
